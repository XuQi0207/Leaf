       The nnssddaaeemmoonn command starts the name server.  This command
       is   usually   executed    at    system    startup    time
       (//eettcc//rrcc..llooccaall).   This will read the name server configu­
       ration file, create the "/" entry in the  database  if  it
       does  not exist yet, create a pool of threads and look for
       requests.  Each of them is processed  in  a  thread  which
       opens  a  connection  to the database server if necessary.
       When a request has been completed, the thread becomes idle
       until  it is allocated to another request.  The connection
       to the database server is kept open  between  2  requests.
       If  the  name  server is being shutdown or not active, the
       requests are automatically retried by the client API.

       All error messages and statistical information are kept in
       a log.

       The  name  server  listen  port  number  can be defined on
       client hosts and on the name server itself  in  either  of
       the following ways:

              setting an environment variable CNS_PORT

                     setenv CNS_PORT 5010

              an entry in //eettcc//sshhiifftt..ccoonnff like:

                     CNS  PORT 5010

              an entry in //eettcc//sseerrvviicceess like:

                     cns                                 5010/tcp
                             # CASTOR name server

       If none of these methods is used, the default port  number
       is  taken  from  the  definition  of  CNS_PORT in Cns_con­
       stants.h.

       The name server host name can be defined on  client  hosts
       in either of the following ways:

              setting an environment variable CNS_HOST, for exam­
              ple:

                     setenv CNS_HOST castor5

              an entry in //eettcc//sshhiifftt..ccoonnff for example:

                     CNS  HOST castor5

       If none of these methods is  used,  the  default  host  is
       taken from the definition of NsHost in site.def.

       The  name  server database keeps the metadata information:
       filename, file size, access time, permissions  and  migra­
       tion status.

       The  name  server  configuration  file  contains  password
       information for the database and must be readable/writable
       only by root.  It contains a single line in the format:

              username/password@server
       where  'username'  and  'password'  are the credentials to
       login to the database instance identified by 'server'.

       In the log each entry has a timestamp.  All entries corre­
       sponding  to  one  request  have the same request id.  For
       each user command there is one message NS092 giving infor­
       mation  about  the  requestor (hostname, uid, gid) and one
       message NS098 giving the command itself.   The  completion
       code of the command is also logged.
