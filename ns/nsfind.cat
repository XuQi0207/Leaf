       nnssffiinndd searches for files in CASTOR name server.

       _p_a_t_h_-_l_i_s_t
              specifies  the  list  of CASTOR pathnames.  If _p_a_t_h
              does not start with //, it is prefixed by  the  con­
              tent of the CCAASSTTOORR__HHOOMMEE environment variable.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --aattiimmee _n_b_d_a_y_s
              if _n_b_d_a_y_s is is just a number, the file is selected
              if it was accessed exactly _n_b_d_a_y_s ago. If the argu­
              ment is in the form +n, this means more than n days
              ago and if the argument is in  the  form  -n,  this
              means less than n days ago.

       --ccttiimmee _n_b_d_a_y_s
              the  file  is selected if its status changed _n_b_d_a_y_s
              ago. See -atime above.

       --iinnuumm _f_i_l_e_i_d
              the file is selected if its fileid matches  _f_i_l_e_i_d.

       --llss    list  current  file  in  "nsls  -dil"  format, i.e.
              gives the file id, the file  mode,  the  number  of
              entries  in  the directory, the owner in alphabetic
              form if the user ID is defined in the  ppaasssswwdd  file
              else  as  a decimal number, the group in alphabetic
              form if the group ID is defined in the  ggrroouupp  file
              else  as  a decimal number, the file size, the last
              modification date and the file name.

              The mode is printed as 10 characters, the first one
              is  dd  for  a  directory, DD for a logically deleted
              file, mm for a migrated file and  --  for  a  regular
              file.   The  next  9 characters are three triplets:
              the  first  triplet  gives  read,  write  and  exe­
              cute/search  permission  for  the owner, the second
              triplet for the group and the last one for the oth­
              ers.

                      rr      the file is readable

                      ww      the file is writable

                      xx      the file is executable or the direc­
                             tory is searchable

                      --      permission is not granted

                      ss      set-user-ID or set-group-ID  bit  is
                             on

                      tt      sticky bit is on

       --mmttiimmee _n_b_d_a_y_s
              the file is selected if it has been modified _n_b_d_a_y_s
              ago. See -atime above.

       --nnaammee _p_a_t_t_e_r_n
              select the file if the file  name  matches  regular
              expression _p_a_t_t_e_r_n.
