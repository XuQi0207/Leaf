       nnssllss lists CASTOR name server directory/file entries.   If
       _p_a_t_h  is  a directory, nnssllss list the entries in the direc­
       tory; they are sorted alphabetically.

       _p_a_t_h   specifies the CASTOR pathname.  If  _p_a_t_h  does  not
              start  with //, it is prefixed by the content of the
              CCAASSTTOORR__HHOOMMEE environment variable.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS
       --cc     use time of last metadata modification  instead  of
              last file modification.

       --dd     if  _p_a_t_h  is  a directory, list the directory entry
              itself, not the files in that directory.

       --ii     print the file uniqueid in front of each entry.

       --ll     long listing (see below).

       --RR     list the contents of directories recursively.

       --TT     list file segments migrated to tape.

       --uu     use last access time instead of last  modification.

       ----ccllaassss
              print the file class in front of each entry.

       ----ccoommmmeenntt
              print  the  comment associated with the entry after
              the pathname.

       ----ddeelleetteedd
              print also the logically deleted files.

       ----ddiissppllaayy__ssiiddee or ----ddss
              print the vid followed by a slash followed  by  the
              media side number.  This option is valid only if -T
              is specified and is useful  for  multi-sided  media
              like DVD.

       ----cchheecckkssuumm
              displays the checksum of the file segments migrated
              to tape. This option should only be used  with  the
              -T  option  as it displays the tape segments check­
              sum.

       The long list gives the file mode, the number  of  entries
       in the directory, the owner in alphabetic form if the user
       ID is defined in the ppaasssswwdd file else as a decimal number,
       the group in alphabetic form if the group ID is defined in
       the ggrroouupp file else as a decimal number,  the  file  size,
       the last modification date and the file name.

       The  mode  is printed as 10 characters, the first one is dd
       for a directory, DD for a logically deleted file, mm  for  a
       migrated  file and -- for a regular file.  The next 9 char­
       acters are three triplets: the first triplet  gives  read,
       write  and  execute/search  permission  for the owner, the
       second triplet for the group and the last one for the oth­
       ers.

              rr      the file is readable

              ww      the file is writable

              xx      the  file  is executable or the directory is
                     searchable

              --      permission is not granted

              ss      set-user-ID or set-group-ID bit is on

              tt      sticky bit is on

       The file segments list gives the file segment status,  the
       copy  number,  the  file  segment  number, the tape visual
       identifier, the file sequence number on tape, the blockid,
       the  segment  size,  the  compression  factor and the file
       name.  The segment status can be either --  for  an  active
       segment or DD for a logically deleted segment.
